                <h2 id="michael-jordan">1. Michael Jordan</h2>
                <h3>The ultimate competitor</h3>
                <p>
                    How much of an explanation do you need here? Of course Michael Jordan is No. 1. 
                    This man won three in a row, left to play baseball, then came back to win three 
                    in a row again, and then he came back one more time and was one of the oldest players
                    to average 20 PPG and to score 40-plus in a game. The GOAT, no question. But I’m
                    still going to remind you that he never played in a Finals Game 7 in six appearances
                    and won a Defensive Player of the Year award (‘88) along with his five MVPs, six
                    Finals MVPs, and was named to the NBA’s 75th anniversary team. He played at the
                    highest level on both sides of the floor and like Bill Russell before him knew 
                    exactly what he had to do to help his team win day in and day out. Jordan never took
                    a game off, he was a maniac for better or worse. My guy was brought to tears when he
                    looked back at how maniacal he was towards his teammates. ESPN’s The Last Dance tried
                    its best to encapsulate MJ’s stranglehold on the basketball world and still didn’t do
                    it justice. No guard has ever dominated the league like he did, which helps his case
                    when you see him on the top of everyone’s list. There will never be another Michael
                    Jordan. The winning, the endorsements, the shoes, the legacy. He did it all and made
                    sure you knew about it along the way. All with a smile on his face and a cigar about to be lit.
                </p>

                <!-- Player 2 -->
                <h2 id="lebron-james">2. LeBron James</h2>
                <h3>The King</h3>
                <p>
                    When you think of LeBron James, you think of greatness. From the first dribble he took in an
                    NBA game up until now, he’s done nothing but live up to the massive hype that was placed on
                    his shoulders coming out of high school in Akron, Ohio. LeBron not only matched the hype, 
                    but he exceeded it. And let’s be honest, you’re being naive if you don’t think he has a chance
                    to take the No. 1 spot on this list when his career is over. The Michael Jordan vs. LeBron
                    James debate will never cease, but the fact that LeBron has already made it to this level
                    is pretty damn amazing. We could go through all the stats and the awards to prove why
                    James should be where he is on this list, but there’s really no need. We all know what
                    he’s done and will continue to do for at least a few more years. For me, what secured
                    James’ spot in the conversation with MJ was his performance in 2016 when he led the
                    Cleveland Cavaliers back from a 3-1 deficit against the 73-win Golden State Warriors.
                    In my book, that’s the single greatest achievement in NBA history and will be hard 
                    to top. From dropping 41 in back-to-back games to the block in Game 7, LeBron leveled
                    up in 2016. A member of the league’s 75th anniversary team, he long ago reached a
                    different plane of basketball greatness that only himself and Jordan occupy. They breath 
                    different air than the rest of us and that’s ok.Let’s not forget LeBron has passed Kareem
                    to become the No. 1 scorer in NBA history. The irony of it is that most of his career, 
                    LeBron has not been recognized for his scoring ability despite his numbers.

                <!-- Player 3 -->
                <h2 id="kareem-abdul-jabbar">3. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</h2>
                <h3>The Legend</h3>
                <p>
                    inventor of the most lethal shot in Association history, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar skyhook-ed his 
                    way to 38,387 career points. You’re not supposed to win NBA Finals MVP awards 14 years apart, 
                    but Abdul-Jabbar did. He earned just about every individual honor a superstar can earn, most 
                    especially six MVPs (one more than Russell and Jordan) and he’s still the only player in league 
                    history to win an MVP despite his team not making the playoffs. Of course he made the NBA 75 squad. 
                    Splitting his time between the Bucks and Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar won three MVPs with each franchise 
                    and five of his six rings in Los Angeles. A 19-time All-Star who 15 times finished in the top 5 
                    of the MVP voting, we’ll spare you from listing out all his accolades because you’d be scrolling 
                    this fine piece of #content for hours. All you really need to know is that Abdul-Jabbar is the 
                    greatest center and it’s not even a debate. Bill Russell might have more titles, Wilt Chamberlain 
                    might have all those untouchable records, but Abdul-Jabbar was offensively skilled in ways Russell 
                    never was and retired as the league leader in nine statistical categories thanks to an impressive 
                    staying power Chamberlain couldn’t match. Abdul-Jabbar wasn’t physically dominant the way Wilt or 
                    Shaquille O’Neal was, but his fluidity was something special for someone of his gargantuan size. 
                    All other big man bow down to The Captain.

                <!-- Player 4 -->
                <h2 id="magic-johnson">4. Magic Johnson</h2>
                <h3>The Floor General</h3>
                <p>
                    When you talk about best PGs in NBA history, it would be impossible to not have Magic Johnson as No. 1. 
                    For this list, he lands at No. 4 overall and for good reason. Magic simply changed the game of basketball 
                    when he burst onto the NBA scene out of Michigan State in 1979. Just think about how incredible it is that 
                    in his first season in the league, Magic started Game 6 of the NBA Finals at center and dropped 42 points. 
                    He played all five positions in the game and led the Lakers to their first title in nearly a decade. This was 
                    just the start for Magic, who at his size, completely changed the way the basketball world looked at guards. 
                    His numbers and accolades look unreal in 2020. With five championships, three MVPs, nine-time All-NBA first 
                    team selections, and inclusion on the NBA’s 75th anniversary team, Magic had one of the best careers in league 
                    history. And the best part? Magic made the game fun—that’s what made Magic so special as a player. He and Larry 
                    Bird literally saved the league in the 80s and while they couldn’t have been more different stylistically there’s 
                    no argument whose influence on the game of basketball was greater. The captain of the “Showtime” Lakers should 
                    firmly be included on anyone’s NBA top 5 list.

                <!-- Player 5 -->
                <h2 id="larry-bird">5. Larry Bird</h2>
                <h3>The Hick from French Lick</h3>
                <p>
                    Boston’s had more than its fair share of Hall of Famers roll through the old Boston Garden, but nobody was as 
                    lethal a scorer or as clutch at the end of games like Larry Legend. A three-time champion who won three consecutive 
                    MVPs in the mid-80s, and obviously made the NBA’s 75th anniversary team, Bird knocked down daggers like it was nothing 
                    and loved ripping out the hearts of his rivals while talking some of the most underrated trash. One of the greatest What 
                    Ifs in NBA history revolves around Bird’s back that he infamously injured while paving his mother’s driveway during the 
                    summer of 1985. If Bird wasn’t Mr. DIY, it’s staggering to think what else he could’ve done since he was never quite the 
                    same after that and horribly hobbled his final few years in the league. But it didn’t stop him from averaging 24.3 PPG 
                    and 10.0 RPG for his 13 seasons. Bird filled up a box score but he was never strictly a numbers guy—he was just a winner 
                    who made ridiculous passes, had a knack for seeing everything unfold seconds before anyone else on the court, and always 
                    made the key play that either sealed the deal or keyed a game-defining run. That’s why even though he could barely get 
                    loose enough to play at the end of his final season, Bird was one of the most celebrated members of the legendary Dream 
                    Team. There was no way the greatest basketball squad ever assembled could leave off the greatest small forward the game 
                    had ever known at that point. Bird’s been supplanted by someone else on that mythical list, but the Hick from French Lick 
                    is forever a Legend.

                <!-- Player 6 -->
                <h2 id="shaquille-oneal">6. Shaquille O'Neal</h2>
                <h3>The Most Dominant Force Of All Time</h3>
                <p>
                    The. Most. Dominant. Ever. Dominant seems like the only adjective to describe Shaq’s career. Shaq, obviously a member of 
                    the NBA 75 team, is one of the most skilled bigs ever to touch a basketball and we’ve all seen the video of him cooking MJ 
                    in a one-on-one before the All-Star Game. The beauty of Shaq’s dominance is that you could know after two dribbles that he 
                    was about to hit you with a dropstep in the post, but you just weren’t going to stop it even if you knew it was coming. It 
                    was either a bucket or a foul. We may never see a 7’1”, 365-pound big that was as explosive, athletic, and quick as Shaq. 
                    He was truly a one of a kind and easily one of the most entertaining players—on and off-the-court—that the NBA has ever seen. 
                    There will never be another Shaq.

                <!-- Player 7 -->
                <h2 id="Kobe-Bryant">7. Kobe Bryant</h2>
                <h3>The Black Mamba</h3>
                <p>
                this isn’t a reactionary decision to Kobe Bryant’s passing. I personally think it’s disrespectful to leave Kobe Bean Bryant out 
                of the top five of any all time list. Magic and Shaq crowned Kobe as the greatest Laker ever after he retired. Shouldn’t that 
                tell you something? We can talk about the way Kobe impacted the game and the culture of basketball but that shouldn’t even be 
                a measurement. We see the multitude of accomplishments like NBA MVP, 5-time champion, two-time Finals MVP, 18-time All-Star, 
                nine All-Defensive First Team selections, the now fourth leading scorer, and so on. Even with all those accomplishments people 
                try to tear him down with advanced statistics like usage rate and efficiency. To me, that’s absolutely silly for a guy who still 
                managed to win just as many or more titles than Bird, LeBron, Wilt, Magic, and Shaq. Did you really watch Kobe Bryant—member of 
                the NBA’s 75th anniversary team—for 20 years and say to yourself, “Well he’s not that efficient so I don’t think he’s great as 
                he’s portrayed”? Social media can be a blessing and a curse so please don’t buy into the nonsense that Bryant wasn’t as great 
                as he was. RIP Mamba.

                <!-- Player 8 -->
                <h2 id="Tim-Duncan">8. Tim Duncan</h2>
                <h3>The Big Fundamental</h3>
                <p>
                If you know The Big Fundamental’s backstory then you know the idea that he would become one of basketball’s greatest power forwards 
                is preposterous. Duncan grew up in the US Virgin Islands. He was a swimmer and didn’t start playing basketball until later as a teen. 
                After four years at Wake Forest, he morphed into a generational talent that every horrible team during the 1996-97 season hoped it would 
                land so he could single-handedly reverse their fortunes. The Spurs lucked out, drafted Timmy, and became a quasi-dynasty. NBA 75 honoree, 
                five-time champion, three-time Finals MVP, two-time regular-season MVP, 15-time All-Star, 15-time All-NBA and All-Defensive team selection 
                later, Duncan played all 19 seasons in San Antonio and consistently put up numbers like he was a robot—with the personality, as portrayed 
                by the media, to match. Sure, Duncan benefited greatly from playing alongside the legend David Robinson and future Hall of Famers Tony 
                Parker, Manu Ginobli, Pau Gasol, and Kawhi Leonard. But other than potentially Leonard, Duncan will shine brighter than all the other 
                great players who have ever played for the Spurs—and just about every other power forward in NBA history—because of how rock steady 
                solid he was. He’s top 10 in rebounds, blocks, win shares, and defensive win shares. Yeah, injuries cut him down his last few seasons, 
                but from his Rookie of the Year campaign during the ’97-98 season through the 2009-10 season, Duncan was good for a double-double. 
                In 251 playoff games, he averaged 19.9 PPG and 11.0 RPG. It’s the playoff excellence that helps elevate Duncan above the more physically 
                and athletically gifted contemporary power forwards like Karl Malone and Kevin Garnett. But it’s his quiet, dignified manner that’s 
                earned him the most praise. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich put it best when the franchise retired Duncan’s jersey. “He’s an enigma in some 
                ways. You think Kawhi Leonard doesn’t talk much,” Popovich said. “When Timmy first got here, it was like mental telepathy. I would say 
                something to him and he would stare. I wasn’t sure if he was paying attention…finally I realize he understood everything I was saying. 
                Probably agreed with half of it, but was so respectful he wouldn’t say anything until later.” After hashing things out, Pop often let 
                Duncan have his way. Can’t argue with the results.

                <h3>Mr 11 Championships</h3>
                <p>
                    You want to talk about underrated? Bill Russell is grossly disrespected when talking about the greats. Not only is he the 
                    greatest winner in all of American sports, Russell is also both the smartest and best defensive player to ever pick up a 
                    basketball. Like Kareem’s skyhook, Bill’s knack for keeping balls in play after a block is a lost art as players would 
                    rather swat it into the stands and flex on their opponent instead of making the right play. His signature play of tapping 
                    the ball to a teammate helped him invent the fast break. Blocks and steals weren’t tallied back then, but there are 
                    researchers that claim Russell averaged anywhere between 8-12 blocks per game. Not only did Russell win 11 NBA titles, 
                    the last two were as player-coach and he’s undefeated in Game 7s, going 10-0 when it’s win or go home time. Wilt 
                    Chamberlain is only close because his numbers are just too ridiculous, but he couldn’t beat Bill even with 
                    Jerry West and Elgin Baylor’s help. The only player in history to come close to matching his winning is Michael Jordan. 
                    Players don’t choose the era they play in, all we can do is look at who dominated it. And nobody on this list comes close 
                    to what Russell, and obvious NBA 75th anniversary team member, has done. There’s a reason why the Finals MVP award is 
                    named after him. He was truly ahead of his time.

                <h2 id="Wilt-chamberlain">10. Wilt Chamberlain</h2>
                <h3>The Original Freak Of Nature</h3>
                <p>
                    Some of us are willing to die on the “Wilt Chamberlain Belongs on the NBA’s Mt. Rushmore” hill because nobody changed the 
                    game like Wilt the Stilt did. NO. BODY. Seriously, they made rules to try and limit his dominance since he owns records no 
                    player now or in the future will ever come close to eclipsing. Who else is going to average 50.4 PPG for a season like Wilt 
                    did in the 1961-62 season? Anybody else going to averaged 22.9 RPG during their career like Wilt did? Who will ever score 
                    100 points in a game like Wilt did? You’re telling me somebody’s going to average more than 45.8 minutes per game like Wilt 
                    did during his 13 seasons in the NBA? And no soul will ever approach his 23,924 career rebounds. Tim Duncan, the best 
                    rebounder the game’s seen since Moses Malone and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, finished 9,000 boards behind Chamberlain despite 
                    playing five more seasons than the legendary lothario. Haters will counter that Wilt played against a bunch of stiffs in 
                    the 60s and 70s when the idea that a 7’1” center could be the most athletic player on the court was reserved for comic 
                    books. But you can only dominate the competition in front of you and the NBA did its best to reign in The Big Dipper, who 
                    rightfully earned a spot on the NBA’s 75th anniversary squad, when opponents couldn’t. Because of Chamberlain’s domination, 
                    the league widened the lane, outlawed players rebounding missed free throws before the ball touched the rim, changed the 
                    definition of offensive goaltending, and forbade inbounds passes over the basket because it was an automatic alley-oop to 
                    Wilt every single time. Jordan may be the GOAT, and the league most definitely altered some of its laws in his wake, but MJ 
                    never altered the rule book the way Chamberlain did
